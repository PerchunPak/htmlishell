A super simple HTML to bash compiler, inspired by [this moment](https://youtu.be/mokGJiXVw_4?t=1384).

  I hate JS so much so I won't do react, but rather just html   
```

## Examples

I am too dumb (and lazy too) to do all the bash spec, so I just did a few features.

### Simple `ls`

```html
<ls />
```

Transforms into

```bash
ls
```

### `ls` with arguments

```html
<ls>
  <all />
</ls>
```

Transforms into

```bash
ls --all
```

### `ls` with short arguments

```html
<ls>
  <all />
  <l short=true />
</ls>
```

Transforms into

```bash
ls --all -l
```

## Installing

Do not use `pip` for Python packages (see [this](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/externally-managed-environments/#externally-managed-environments)).
TLDR: not venv-wide `pip` installation may break your system, use [`pipx`](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/) (it will manage venvs for you).

```bash
pipx install bash-react
```

Then run

```bash
htmlishell ./path/to/your/file.html
```

## Installing for local developing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PerchunPak/bash-react.git
cd bash-react
```

### Installing `poetry`

Next we need install `poetry` with [recommended way](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/#installation).

If you use Linux, use command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python -
```

If you use Windows, open PowerShell with admin privileges and use:

```powershell
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | python -
```

### Installing dependencies

```bash
poetry install
```

### If something is not clear

You can always write to me!
